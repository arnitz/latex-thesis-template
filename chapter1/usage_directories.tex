\newsection{Layout of Files/Directories}{intro:directories}

Bringing order to the chaos of a thesis is always a problem. The file/directory structure in particular can become huge and make changes difficult. The command \verb|\pwd| (``present working directory'') can be used to divide the thesis into smaller parts and make absolute paths (from the main file) unnecessary.

By starting a new chapter with \verb|\newchapter{Introduction}{intro}| directly followed by \linebreak%this linebreak is here for layout purposes only
\verb|\renewcommand{\pwd}{chapter1}|, the working directory is set to the subdirectory \verb|chapter1|. The command \verb|\pwd| can then be used in all file paths, e.g., with \verb|\input| or \verb|\includegraphics|, to make sure all files can be loaded without having to define a path. For example, this file is loaded via \verb|\input{\pwd/intro_basics}|.

Consider creating one directory per chapter, and one file per section. This will make it easier to identify the correct file, and also to shift chapters and especially sections. External files (figures, code, \dots) should be placed in identically named subdirectories for each chapter. This makes it extremely simple to restructure your thesis without having to update file paths.
